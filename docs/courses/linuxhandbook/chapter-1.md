## Bash

1. Bash is a computer program lives in the Terminal.&#x20;
2. Bash is an interpreter, it takes a language you speak, or type, and translates it into a language the Operating System can understand.&#x20;
3. The Operating System is the conductor for the Computer Hardware.&#x20;
4. Computer Hardware is all the physical stuff that makes up a computer; the display, keyboard, RAM memory, storage memory (disks) etc.
5. The Terminal is is where you talk to the Operating System through Bash.&#x20;
6. The Terminal is also called a Command-Line Interface (CLI).
7. Bash is also known as a shell. There are many types of shells, Bash is just one of them.&#x20;
8. You give Bash Commands, in Linux these commands are instructions used to tell the operating system (Ubuntu Linux) what to do.

So, you give Bash instructions by typing them into the Terminal, Bash interpenetrates those instruction and tells the Operating System what to do using the Computer Hardware.&#x20;
